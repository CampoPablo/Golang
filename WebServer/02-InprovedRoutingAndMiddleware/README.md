# Modern Web Application

In this later, I Indtroduce some concepts like

- Routing: using pat for routing
- Routing: using chi for routing
- Developing our own middleware

I use the package bmizerany for implementing pat


```
https://github.com/bmizerany/pat
```


This packages import in our own code

```
$ go get github.com/bmizerany/pat
```

```
$go get hithub.com/go-chi/chi
```

```
$go get hithub.com/justinas/nosurf
```
