#Prototype design pattern

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it possible to copy objects even if their concrete classes are unknown. Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class can access each otherâ€™s private fields.
