## Introduction
A calendar time, also called an absolute time, is a point in the time continuum, for example July 29, 2021 at 13:02:5 CET. A time interval is a continuous part of the time continuum between two calendar times; for instance the hour between 15:00 and 19:00 on February 20, 2020. An elapsed time is the length of an interval, for example, 38 minutes.

An amount of time is a sum of elapsed times. The elapsed times do not need to be successive. When the work took us eleven hours, we might be working on different days. A period is the elapsed time of an interval between two events. CPU time is the amount of time for which a central processing unit (CPU) was used for processing instructions of a computer program or operating system. It is measured in clock ticks or seconds. An epoch is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular era. The Unix epoch is the time 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (or 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z ISO 8601).

Wall time, also called real-world time or wall-clock time, refers to elapsed time as determined by a chronometer such as a wristwatch or wall clock. (The reference to a wall clock is how the term originally got its name.) Wall time differs from time as measured by counting microprocessor clock pulses or cycles.
