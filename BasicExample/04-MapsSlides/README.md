#Go map

Go map tutorial shows how to work with maps in Golang.

A map is an unordered collection of key/value pairs, where each key is unique. Maps are also called dictionaries, associative arrays, or hash tables. The size of the map (the number of key-value pairs) is determined with the len function.

Maps are created with make function or with map literals.
